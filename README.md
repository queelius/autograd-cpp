## The Mathematics of Automatic Differentiation

### Why Computational Graphs?

In scientific computing, machine learning, and optimization, we constantly need derivatives. Whether training neural networks, solving differential equations, or optimizing engineering designs, the ability to compute gradients efficiently and accurately is fundamental. autograd-cpp provides a high-performance C++ library for automatic differentiation through computational graphs.

### The Computational Graph

A computational graph represents a function `f` as a directed acyclic graph where:

- **Nodes** represent operations (add, multiply, exp, log, etc.)
- **Edges** represent data flow between operations
- **Leaves** are input variables
- **Root** is the output

Consider a simple function: `f(x, y) = (x * y) + exp(x)`

```text
     y -------------+
                    |
                    !
     x ----+-----> [*] -----> [+] ----> f
           |                   ^
           |                   |
           |                 [exp]
           |                   ^ 
           |                   |
           +-------------------+
```

Each node stores:

1. **Value (forward pass)**: The computed result after forward propagation
2. **Gradient (backward pass)**: The derivative ∂f/∂node for this node
3. **Children/Parents**: Pointers to connected nodes in the graph
4. **Backward function**: The local gradient computation rule

### Example: Simple Linear Function

Let's start with `f(x) = 2x + 2` with `x=3.0`:

```text
Computational Graph:
     x=3.0 ────→ [×] ────→ [+] ───→ f=8.0
                  ↑         ↑
                  │         │
                2.0        2.0

After Forward Pass:
     x: val=3.0 ────→ [×]: val=6.0 ────→ [+]: val=8.0 ───→ f: val=8.0
                       ↑                   ↑
                       │                   │
                    2.0: val=2.0        2.0: val=2.0

After Backward Pass (with ∂f/∂f = 1):
     x: val=3.0 ────→ [×]: val=6.0 ────→ [+]: val=8.0 ───→ f: val=8.0
        grad=2.0         grad=1.0           grad=1.0         grad=1.0f.
                       ↑                   ↑
                       │                   │
                    2.0: val=2.0        2.0: val=2.0
                    (no grad)           (no grad)
```

**How the gradient flows (backpropagation):**

1. Start: `∂f/∂f = 1` (gradient of f with respect to itself)
2. At [+] node: `∂f/∂[+] = 1` (addition passes gradient unchanged)
   - Left child [×]: gets `∂f/∂[×] = ∂f/∂[+] × 1 = 1`
   - Right child (2.0): constant, so `∂f/∂(2.0) = 0` mathematically, but we don't store it
3. At [×] node: `∂f/∂[×] = 1` (received from parent)
   - Left child x: gets `∂f/∂x = ∂f/∂[×] × 2.0 = 1 × 2.0 = 2`
   - Right child (2.0): constant, so `∂f/∂(2.0) = 0` mathematically, but we don't store it

**Important distinction:**
- **Mathematical truth**: `∂f/∂c = 0` for any constant `c`
- **Implementation choice**: We don't allocate gradient storage for constants (no `requires_grad`)
- **Why**: Saves memory and computation - we only track gradients for parameters we want to optimize

**Key insight:** Each operation node multiplies the incoming gradient by its local derivative:

- Addition: local derivative = 1 for both inputs → passes gradient unchanged
- Multiplication: local derivative = other operand → multiplies by the other input's value

### Example: Nested Operations

For `f(x, y) = exp(x * (y + 2))` with `x=3.0` and `y=1.0`:

```text
Forward Pass (computing values):

     y=1.0 -----> [+] -----> [*] -----> [exp] ----> f=81.45
                   ^          ^           
                   |          |           
                  2.0       x=3.0        

Step by step:
1. [+] = y + 2 = 1.0 + 2.0 = 3.0
2. [*] = x × [+] = 3.0 × 3.0 = 9.0
3. [exp] = exp([*]) = exp(9.0) = 8103.08
4. f = 8103.08

Backward Pass (computing gradients):

     y: val=1.0 -----> [+]: val=3.0 -----> [*]: val=9.0 -----> [exp]: val=8103.08 ----> f: val=8103.08
        grad=24309.24      grad=24309.24       grad=8103.08         grad=1.0              grad=1.0
                        ^                    ^           
                        |                    |           
                     2.0: val=2.0         x: val=3.0
                        (no grad)            grad=24309.24

Step by step (starting from f, working backward):
1. f: grad = 1.0 (∂f/∂f = 1)
2. [exp]: grad = 1.0 (from f)
3. [*]: grad = grad[exp] × exp([*]) = 1.0 × 8103.08 = 8103.08
   (derivative of exp(u) is exp(u), so ∂[exp]/∂[*] = exp(9.0))
4. [+]: grad = grad[*] × x = 8103.08 × 3.0 = 24309.24
   (∂[*]/∂[+] = x = 3.0)
5. x: grad = grad[*] × [+] = 8103.08 × 3.0 = 24309.24
   (∂[*]/∂x = [+] = 3.0)
6. y: grad = grad[+] × 1 = 24309.24 × 1 = 24309.24
   (∂[+]/∂y = 1)

Verification:
- ∂f/∂x = exp(x(y+2)) × (y+2) = 8103.08 × 3.0 = 24309.24 ✓
- ∂f/∂y = exp(x(y+2)) × x = 8103.08 × 3.0 = 24309.24 ✓
```

### Example: More Complex Function

For `f(x, y) = (x * y) + exp(x)` with `x=2.0` and `y=3.0`:

```text
Forward Pass (computing values):

     y=3.0 -------------+
                        |
                        ↓
     x=2.0 ----+-----> [×]=6.0 -----> [+]=13.39 ----> f=13.39
               |                       ↑
               |                       |
               |                    [exp]=7.39
               |                       ↑ 
               |                       |
               +----------------------+

Step by step:
1. [×] = x × y = 2.0 × 3.0 = 6.0
2. [exp] = exp(x) = exp(2.0) = 7.39
3. [+] = [×] + [exp] = 6.0 + 7.39 = 13.39
4. f = 13.39

Backward Pass (computing gradients):

     y: val=3.0 -------------+
        grad=2.0             |
                             ↓
     x: val=2.0 ----+-----> [×]: val=6.0 -----> [+]: val=13.39 ----> f: val=13.39
        grad=10.39  |            grad=1.0            grad=1.0         grad=1.0
                    |                             ↑
                    |                             |
                    |                        [exp]: val=7.39
                    |                             grad=1.0
                    |                             ↑ 
                    |                             |
                    +-----------------------------+

Step by step (starting from f, working backward):
1. f: grad = 1.0 (∂f/∂f = 1)
2. [+]: grad = 1.0 (addition passes gradient unchanged)
3. [×]: grad = 1.0 (received from [+] with local derivative 1)
4. [exp]: grad = 1.0 (received from [+] with local derivative 1)
5. y: grad = ∂f/∂y = grad[×] × x = 1.0 × 2.0 = 2.0
6. x from [×]: grad = grad[×] × y = 1.0 × 3.0 = 3.0
7. x from [exp]: grad = grad[exp] × exp(x) = 1.0 × 7.39 = 7.39
8. x total: grad = 3.0 + 7.39 = 10.39 (sum because x has two paths)
```

### Node Data Structure

Each node contains:
- **data**: Aligned float array for SIMD operations (SSE2/AVX2/AVX512)
- **grad**: Aligned gradient array, same size as data
- **shape**: Tensor dimensions (e.g., [batch_size, features])
- **strides**: Memory layout for efficient indexing
- **requires_grad**: Boolean flag for gradient computation
- **is_leaf**: True for input variables, false for computed values
- **backward_fn**: Lambda capturing the chain rule for this operation

This structure enables us to:
- Compute `f(x)` by traversing forward
- Compute `∇f` by traversing backward
- Track exact derivatives through complex compositions

## The Loss Function and Backpropagation

In machine learning, we typically minimize a loss function `L(θ)` where `θ` are model parameters. The computational graph lets us compute `∂L/∂θᵢ` for all parameters efficiently through **backpropagation**:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute all node values from inputs to loss
2. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients from loss back to parameters

The key insight: the chain rule naturally follows the graph structure:
```
∂L/∂θ = ∂L/∂z · ∂z/∂y · ∂y/∂θ
```

Each node only needs to know its local gradient - the graph handles the global composition.

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include <autograd/autograd.hpp>

using namespace autograd;

// Simple gradient computation
auto x = tensor({2, 3}, requires_grad=true);
auto y = tensor({3, 2}, requires_grad=true);
auto z = matmul(x, y);
auto loss = sum(z);

loss->backward();
// Now x->grad and y->grad contain gradients

// Jacobian computation
auto jacobian = compute_jacobian(z, x);

// Hessian for optimization
auto hessian = compute_hessian(loss, x);
```

## Examples

### Neural Network
```cpp
// Define a simple model
auto model = Sequential({
    Linear(784, 128),
    ReLU(),
    Linear(128, 10)
});

// Training loop
for (auto& batch : data) {
    auto output = model->forward(batch.inputs);
    auto loss = cross_entropy(output, batch.targets);
    
    optimizer.zero_grad();
    loss->backward();
    optimizer.step();
}
```

### Statistical Computing
```cpp
// Maximum likelihood estimation
auto mu = tensor({1}, requires_grad=true);
auto sigma = tensor({1}, requires_grad=true);

for (auto& x : data) {
    auto likelihood = normal_pdf(x, mu, sigma);
    auto nll = -log(likelihood);
    
    nll->backward();
    // Use gradients for optimization
}
```

### Physics Simulation
```cpp
// Compute forces from potential energy
auto positions = tensor({n_particles, 3}, requires_grad=true);
auto potential = compute_potential(positions);

potential->backward();
// positions->grad now contains forces (negative gradient)
```

## Quantization for Memory Efficiency

```cpp
// Run models on limited RAM
auto model = load_model("model.bin");
model->quantize(Precision::INT8);  // 4x memory reduction

// Still accurate for inference
auto output = model->forward(input);
```
